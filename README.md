HC-05
=====

This application is based on the hc-05 source code found here: https://github.com/gi097/HC-05
Credits go to giovanniterlingen.

This app will easily set up a connection for you with the HC-05 bluetooth module, which is used for example on the Arduino. Once you are connected it will open a socket, so you can pass data to the device.

Many changes have been made to make the app fit our robotCar project, at the request of HAN https://www.han.nl/
A drawer has been implemented to ease the navigation between different modes.
The behavior of the buttons and seekbar are changed to increase the intuitivity when remote controlling our vehicle.
